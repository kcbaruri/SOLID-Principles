SOLID is an acronym for five principles of architecture.

**S – Single Responsibility Principle**. It states that every class should have single responsibility. A class should not have more than one reason to change.

**O – Open Close Principle.** A class should be open for an extension and closed for the modification.

**L – Liskov Substitution Principle .** A parent object should be able to replace its child during runtime polymorphism.

**I –Interface Segregation Principle.** Client specific interfaces are better than general purpose interfaces.

**D – Dependency Inversion Principle.** Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use
